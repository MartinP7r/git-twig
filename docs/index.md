**Git-Twig** is a command-line tool designed to help developers manage their Git repositories with speed and clarity. Instead of reading a flat list of modified files, git-twig provides an interactive tree view that allows you to stage, unstage, and inspect changes directly from your terminal.

## Key Features

- **Interactive TUI**: Navigate your repository with familiar Vim bindings.
- **Actionable Tree**: Stage (`Space`) or View Diff (`Enter`) items directly.
- **Smart Folding**: Keep your view clean by folding directories you're not working on.
- **Power User Efficiency**: High-speed navigation with `gg`, `G`, and `Ctrl+u/d`.
- **Customizable**: Tailor keybindings and themes to your preferences.

## Why Git-Twig?

Standard `git status` output is excellent for a quick glance, but it's passive. Git-twig turns that output into a workspace. It's built in Rust for extreme performance and provides a premium terminal experience.
